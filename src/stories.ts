Had many memories of laughing at each other's inside jokes, encouraging each other, and also serious moments of class criticisms and working till late in the night, or else we wouldn't be able to submit our final A level piece! I loved that we have a room to call our own, just for the 11 of us :\") We also used to have a stray cat that would also wander around our works ‚Äî he was lovingly named Magritte and he brought us so much joy till he was adopted! Will always hold all this dear to my heart!",

When I found out from a local newspaper that there exists the Museum of Broken Relationships, I was sad and happy at the same time. This is a postcard that was inserted through the slit of my door a long time ago by our neighbours' son. He had been in love with me for three years. Following the old Armenian tradition, his parents came to our home to ask for my hand. My parents refused saying that their son did not deserve me. They left angry and very disappointed. The same evening their son drove his car off a cliff...",
